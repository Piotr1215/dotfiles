## Style Guidelines

Style guidelines and rules that need to be adhered to:

- never bold out content of bullet point lists

  EXAMPLE:
  ---
  title: Using CLI
  sidebar_label: Using CLI
  sidebar_position: 1
  description: Learn how to deploy the vCluster Platform to a Kubernetes cluster using the vCluster CLI.
  ---

- use `` to denote code or names of tools in-line
