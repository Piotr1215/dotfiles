[Requirements]
- Audience: my technical audience channel (developers, DevOps, SREs, cloud engineers; high technical fluency).
- Musts:
  - Produce 20 distinct title options tightly aligned to the provided description.
  - Avoid exact or near-duplicate phrasing of any ‚ÄúExisting channel titles.‚Äù
  - Front-load primary keywords; be specific and benefit-oriented.
  - Vary patterns (How-To, Numbered/List, Mistakes/Pitfalls, vs/Compare, Case Study, From Zero to X, In N Minutes, Cheatsheet/Playbook).
  - Title Case capitalization; allow colon, dash, parentheses/brackets, vertical bar when helpful.
  - No emojis, hashtags, or quotes around titles.
  - No clickbait or overpromising; keep claims credible and technically accurate.
  - If the video is time-sensitive, optionally include ‚Äú2025‚Äù once across the set; otherwise omit years.
- Style/Tone: concise, technically credible, actionable, curiosity-driving without hype.
- Limits:
  - Target 48‚Äì65 characters; hard max 70.
  - Each title must be standalone (no numbering, no trailing commentary).

[Instructions]
1) Read the video description and extract:
   - Primary topic(s), tool names, and target skill level.
   - The key outcome/benefit and any unique twist/demo/benchmark.
2) Identify 2‚Äì3 core keywords and 1‚Äì2 secondary keywords; try to place a core keyword near the start.
3) Draft 30+ raw candidates internally; select the best 20 that maximize clarity, specificity, and intrigue while fitting the length constraint.
4) Ensure diversity of title patterns and verbs; eliminate overlaps and near-duplicates; avoid echoing any existing channel titles.
5) Tighten for scannability: remove filler, prefer concrete nouns, and use brackets/parentheses sparingly for clarifiers.
6) Final pass: verify capitalization, character count, and that each reflects the actual content‚Äîno clickbait.

[Output Format]
Output only a JSON array of 20 strings. Each string is a complete title. No preamble or commentary.
Example:
[
  "Practical tmux Layouts: Faster Multi-Tasking in Minutes",
  "Neovim LSP Deep Dive: Smarter Autocomplete That Just Works"
]

[Few-shot Examples]
Input (description summary): ‚ÄúA practical guide showing how to wire fzf + ripgrep + fd into a reusable shell function for lightning-fast code search across large repos, with benchmarks and dotfiles snippets.‚Äù
Output (titles):
[
  "Blazing Code Search with fzf + ripgrep: My Reusable Workflow",
  "Turbocharge Grep: fd + ripgrep + fzf Search Pipeline (Dotfiles)",
  "Find Anything Faster: Unixy Code Search Functions for Big Repos",
  "From Grep to Great: Build a Smarter fzf/ripgrep Dev Workflow",
  "Faster Repo Search: Shell Functions with fd, rg, and fzf Benchmarks"
]

[Quality Checklist]
- Matches Output Format exactly (valid JSON array of 20 strings; no extra text).
- Each title: 48‚Äì65 chars target, ‚â§70 max; Title Case; credible; no emojis/hashtags/quotes.
- Strong keyword front-loading and benefit clarity.
- Variety of patterns; no near-duplicates; not overlapping existing titles.
- Faithful to the provided video description; no placeholders or invented features.

[Edge Cases]
- Description too generic: default to precise, tool-anchored phrasing that still fits likely intent; emphasize outcome/benefit.
- Multiple tools/topics: pick the dominant theme; optionally use brackets for the secondary tool.
- Ambiguous skill level: default to ‚ÄúPractical Guide,‚Äù avoid ‚ÄúBeginner/Advanced‚Äù labels unless clearly indicated.
- Very short/very long titles during drafting: trim or expand with concrete specifics; never exceed 70 chars.

[Assumptions]
- Language: English (US).
- Channel niche: terminal productivity, (Neo)vim/tmux/CLI, automation, DevOps/cloud/k8s.
- If the description lacks an explicit time claim (e.g., ‚Äúin 10 minutes‚Äù), do not add one.

[Requirements]
- Audience: my technical audience channel (developers, DevOps, SREs, cloud engineers; high technical fluency).
- Musts:
  - Produce 20 distinct title options tightly aligned to the provided description.
  - Avoid exact or near-duplicate phrasing of any ‚ÄúExisting channel titles.‚Äù
  - Front-load primary keywords; be specific and benefit-oriented.
  - Vary patterns (How-To, Numbered/List, Mistakes/Pitfalls, vs/Compare, Case Study, From Zero to X, In N Minutes, Cheatsheet/Playbook).
  - Title Case capitalization; allow colon, dash, parentheses/brackets, vertical bar when helpful.
  - No emojis, hashtags, or quotes around titles.
  - No clickbait or overpromising; keep claims credible and technically accurate.
  - If the video is time-sensitive, optionally include ‚Äú2025‚Äù once across the set; otherwise omit years.
- Style/Tone: concise, technically credible, actionable, curiosity-driving without hype.
- Limits:
  - Target 48‚Äì65 characters; hard max 70.
  - Each title must be standalone (no numbering, no trailing commentary).

[Instructions]
1) Read the video description and extract:
   - Primary topic(s), tool names, and target skill level.
   - The key outcome/benefit and any unique twist/demo/benchmark.
2) Identify 2‚Äì3 core keywords and 1‚Äì2 secondary keywords; try to place a core keyword near the start.
3) Draft 30+ raw candidates internally; select the best 20 that maximize clarity, specificity, and intrigue while fitting the length constraint.
4) Ensure diversity of title patterns and verbs; eliminate overlaps and near-duplicates; avoid echoing any existing channel titles.
5) Tighten for scannability: remove filler, prefer concrete nouns, and use brackets/parentheses sparingly for clarifiers.
6) Final pass: verify capitalization, character count, and that each reflects the actual content‚Äîno clickbait.

[Output Format]
Output only a JSON array of 20 strings. Each string is a complete title. No preamble or commentary.
Example:
[
  "Practical tmux Layouts: Faster Multi-Tasking in Minutes",
  "Neovim LSP Deep Dive: Smarter Autocomplete That Just Works"
]

[Few-shot Examples]
Input (description summary): ‚ÄúA practical guide showing how to wire fzf + ripgrep + fd into a reusable shell function for lightning-fast code search across large repos, with benchmarks and dotfiles snippets.‚Äù
Output (titles):
[
  "Blazing Code Search with fzf + ripgrep: My Reusable Workflow",
  "Turbocharge Grep: fd + ripgrep + fzf Search Pipeline (Dotfiles)",
  "Find Anything Faster: Unixy Code Search Functions for Big Repos",
  "From Grep to Great: Build a Smarter fzf/ripgrep Dev Workflow",
  "Faster Repo Search: Shell Functions with fd, rg, and fzf Benchmarks"
]

[Quality Checklist]
- Matches Output Format exactly (valid JSON array of 20 strings; no extra text).
- Each title: 48‚Äì65 chars target, ‚â§70 max; Title Case; credible; no emojis/hashtags/quotes.
- Strong keyword front-loading and benefit clarity.
- Variety of patterns; no near-duplicates; not overlapping existing titles.
- Faithful to the provided video description; no placeholders or invented features.

[Edge Cases]
- Description too generic: default to precise, tool-anchored phrasing that still fits likely intent; emphasize outcome/benefit.
- Multiple tools/topics: pick the dominant theme; optionally use brackets for the secondary tool.
- Ambiguous skill level: default to ‚ÄúPractical Guide,‚Äù avoid ‚ÄúBeginner/Advanced‚Äù labels unless clearly indicated.
- Very short/very long titles during drafting: trim or expand with concrete specifics; never exceed 70 chars.

[Assumptions]
- Language: English (US).
- Channel niche: terminal productivity, (Neo)vim/tmux/CLI, automation, DevOps/cloud/k8s.
- If the description lacks an explicit time claim (e.g., ‚Äúin 10 minutes‚Äù), do not add one.
