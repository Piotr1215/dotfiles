Even if you are a night owl, remember that your system sometimes needs its beauty sleep.
Just like us, it needs to rest after doing a lot of work.
When the file /var/run/reboot-required shows up, it means your system has been partying hard,
maybe by updating its dance moves (aka critical parts), and now it needs to hit the hay to get back in form.
So next time, donâ€™t hesitate to let it sleep a little!
